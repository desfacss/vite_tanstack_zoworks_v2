# Form System & Inclusive Styling

This document outlines the standardized form element styling system implemented for the project. These styles are designed to provide a premium, cohesive, and "inclusive" look across all themes.

## Automatic Integration
The styling system targets standard Ant Design components directly via global CSS in `src/index.css`. This means you **do not need to add any special classes** to get these styles.

Simply use the standard Ant Design components as usual:

```tsx
import { Input, Select, InputNumber, DatePicker } from 'antd';

// All these will automatically receive the standardized branding, 
// inclusive borders, and custom heights.
<Input prefix={<Search />} placeholder="Search..." />
<Input.Password />
<Input.Group />
<Select />
```

## Design Philosophy: "Inclusive Borders"
Unlike standard form inputs where the border usually wraps only the input field, our "Inclusive Border" system wraps the **entire container**, including prefixes, suffixes, and addons.

### Key Features
1.  **Unified Container**: A single branded border wraps the icon, the input, and any addons.
2.  **Standardized Height**: All form elements (Inputs, Selects, Pickers, Search) are strictly **40px tall** by default to maintain vertical rhythm.
3.  **Subtle Separators**: Vertical divider lines are automatically added between icons/addons and the input field.
4.  **Branded Focus Glow**: When the input is focused, the "Neon Glow" and primary border color apply to the **entire wrapper**, providing clear visual feedback.
5.  **Autofill Protection**: Browser autofill "white patches" are suppressed and replaced with theme-matching backgrounds.

## Supported Components
The following Ant Design components are automatically covered:
- `Input` (including `Prefix`, `Suffix`, `Password`, and `Search`)
- `InputNumber` (including `Prefix`/`Suffix` variants)
- `Select` (Standard selection)
- `DatePicker`, `TimePicker`, `RangePicker`
- `Input.Group` (with Addons)

## Customization
If you need to override these styles for a specific instance, you can use Tailwind utility classes or custom `style` props, but we recommend sticking to the standardized look for consistency.
